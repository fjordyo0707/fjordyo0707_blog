### What will the blog going to talk about?

Mainly, the post will be related to programming. The ideas will be mostly from the self-learning course online or the software tools, like a document for me. The programming language will mainly include:

* C/C++
* Rust
* Python
* Haskell.... maybe??
* OCaml.... maybe??
